# BiKing.com &copy; 2025 v1

Biking.com started as a personal project to learn react and also my love for biking. You will notice bad project structure, un-optimized and redundant codes, and many more flaws which I intend to fix it overtime as I have just started. Most of the features mentioned in below section have not yet started or are in development phase so, consider them as the future enhancement. I work as full time Java Developer having 3 years of experience contributing to this project alone.
